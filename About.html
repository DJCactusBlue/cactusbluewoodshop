      <p>Cactus Blue caught the woodworking bug when he was in 8th grade and had an excellent woodshop teacher. He has tried his hand in several projects and has tried to capture them in photos as the years have passed.</p>
      <p>His most recent interest is turning pens and pencils and other small items. He learns as he goes and finds that being out in the woodshop is almost as good as a round of golf.</p>
